# cchess + cm-chessboard
This is a [cm-chessboard](https://github.com/shaack/cm-chessboard)-based site for playing against my terrible chess AI (cchess) from the comfort of your browser.

**cchess** was a project to try to create an AI that could beat me at chess. Turns out I'm terrible at chess, so the first iteration of the AI is able to consistently take advantage of my mistakes and win. Success!
